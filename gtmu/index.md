title: Grand Tech Meetup 2015
---

We're organising a meet up for the greater UK CS student community!
This would involve a weekend of talks, roundtable discussions, mini
hacks and social events.

- **What?** Tech meetup with talks, round table discussions, and a
  hackathon!
- **Where?** York
- **When?** 31st of October and 1st of November

The goal of the meetup is to bring together students, present and
past, of different universities to share ideas, make new friends, and
promote inter-university fraternisation.

The Saturday will consist of talks, round table discussions, and
workshops, with a social event in the evening. The Sunday will consist
of a hackathon (to be confirmed).

If you are interested in attending, please register your interest so
we have an idea of numbers:
