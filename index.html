  <h1>Unified UK Computer Science Society IRC</h1>

  <p>A number of computer science societies at UK universities who use
  IRC have resurrected the shared channel <tt>#compsoc-uk</tt> on
  freenode as a place for friendly discussion.</p>

  <p>The channel is <tt>#compsoc-uk</tt>
  on <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>. This channel has slightly uncertain
  status, so the channel <tt>#compsoc<b>s</b>-uk</tt> (plural) on freenode has
  been registered a a backup.</p>

  <h3>Bot</h3>
  
  <p>There is (at least one) utility bot in the channel. One of the
  functions it provides is to make it easy to check which university
    and society someone is from (as this question comes up often).</p>

  <p>Type <tt>!whois &lt;nick&gt;</tt> to find the description a user
    has set for themselves.</p>

  <p>Type <tt>!whois.set &lt;description&gt;</tt> to set the
  description for yourself.</p>

  <h3>Known Societies</h3>

  <p>These societies have been seen in the channel.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://comp-soc.com">Edinburgh CompSoc</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.kcltech.com">King's College London Tech Society</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://hacksoc.org">York HackSoc</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://geeksoc.org">Strathclyde GeekSoc</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.uwcs.co.uk">University of Warwick Computing Society</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Future plans</h3>
  <p>Hopefully, various group activities will be organised among the
  people in <tt>#compsoc-uk</tt>. Perhaps when this becomes a proper
  website, those events will be listed here.</p>
  
  <h3>This Website</h3>

  <p>If you'd like to improve this website, it is hosted on GitHub pages, in the repository
  <a href="http://github.com/CompSocs/compsocs.github.io">Compsocs/compsocs.github.io</a>. Send
  a pull request, and ping <tt>qlkzy</tt> (among others) in the
  channel if it seems to be being ignored. Reputable individuals will
  probably be given commit access.</p>
